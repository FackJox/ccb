The violin faltered once, a heartbeat snag, as Ceci dared the room to breathe with her. In the lamplight, flour still ghosted her wrists from the bakery below, and lilac silk clung damp at the hem. She lifted her chin—three-count nested in the pause—and the people lining the confiscated hôtel hallway forgot to blink.

From the corner, where a restless lantern cluster hissed, Jack recognized the rhythm she’d been humming through the market streets. He knew it before he knew her name. He knew it the way a city knows rain.

They were supposed to be alone, “rehearsing,” though that word had become a lie. Neighbors gathered at the edges of the hall. Windows faced the square—too exposed, too dangerous—but Ceci had said softly, _Let them look. Let the city breathe again._

Jack set it down, unwound twine, revealed sheets scored thick with ink. “I wrote a pivot,” he said. “A melody that asks for a different lead.”

Ceci studied the marks as if the music could bruise. Jack watched her read. When she looked up, the room changed temperature, “Will you follow?" he asked.

Consent lives in small sentences. She tipped her head, that chin-lift she didn’t know she’d made in a hundred lives, and he answered by holding out his embrace. Not control. Permission.

Her palm hovered near his wrist without touching. She matched his tempo. She nodded once—permission, acknowledgment, desire braided quiet.

They began again. Her weight forward, his back; his lead, her follow. A pattern older than their names. When the mirror on the far wall slipped its wire and crashed, the silence struck like a held breath—but Ceci didn’t flinch.

“Un. Deux. Trois.”

Her voice carried out the open windows and pulled the square into rhythm.

Boots entered the square below—sharp, official, unwelcome. A street patrol. Jack caught the shift in Ceci’s posture: not fear. Calculation.

“End this!” a captain barked. “Curtains closed. Lights out.”

Ceci’s chin lifted by a fraction—recognition, defiance, maybe destiny.  
Ceci moved first.

She killed the main lanterns; the room dropped into dark velvet. Then she sent the violet spill surging into the windows. The glass flared like a phantom stage. Their bodies became silhouettes—tall, fused, impossible to parse.

A gasp rose from the square. Hundreds of faces turned upward.

Only shadows remained: Ceci and Jack, framed in violet fire.

She stepped into him, closer than the dance required, her breath warm at his jaw. “Follow me,” she whispered—not as command, but invitation.

“Always,” he answered, the word leaving him before he could stop it.

They waltzed, framed by darkness, her lead molten and sure. Her lilac sash—caught by the violet—looked like a wound or a promise. She pressed her palm to his chest for a beat too long, and the square below felt the shift; murmurs turned into rhythm, rhythm into movement. Someone clapped on the count. Another joined. Soon the crowd swayed like a single creature.

The patrol tried to push through, but the crowd moved shoulder to shoulder, too entranced to part. Any force would have meant striking civilians. The soldiers cursed, stuck in the tide they’d meant to control.

Ceci slid her fingers to Jack’s forearm—firm, claiming—guiding him to turn her against the light. The move pressed her body to his, her mouth grazing his cheek as she whispered the next step. Heat traveled through him like memory.

Heat gathered and traveled. Not spectacle; agreement. She felt his choice and answered with one of her own: her hand rose to the back of his neck, gentle, deliberate. A question. A vow. A lifetime rethreading itself.

Jack exhaled her name—“Ceci…”—more confession than breath.

From the street, they looked untouchable. The soldiers, now surrounded by motion and music, began to retreat step by step. Not ordered; inevitable. The rhythm swallowed their authority. One fell back, then another followed. The tide of dancers took the space they vacated until the patrol dissolved into the edges of the square, retreating beneath the swell of applause and violet glow.

When the final note faded, the city exhaled with them. The violet lights guttered out. In the dark, Ceci rested her forehead against his for a heartbeat too long to be innocent. His hands stayed at her waist, not trapping—just holding the moment still.



At dawn, they broomed glass from the ballroom floor together. Below, the square was quiet again: crates, crumbs, a soft memory of defiance. For a long time, the smell of tobacco and mist hung in the air.


On the backstage door, someone had chalked a bright **C/J** beside a streak of flour—no one claiming it; everyone knowing.



Upstairs, their brooms stopped; their feet met.  
A hold.  
Her breath met his.  
Old as anything.  
New as dawn.
