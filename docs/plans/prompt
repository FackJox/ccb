Is there a way that we can normalise the whole scrollytelling experience across devices, like for example the
  'perfect' pace if the user was scrolling constantly, and then set everything based around this. That way we could
  use the time durations, but it's still tied to the scroll 1:1.

  That 'perfect' pace could then be normalised for all different devices.

  There should be some lerp in that perfect pace for when the user starts scrolling and stops scrolling
