# Chapter Map

This chapter map is your spine. Each chapter maps to the storyboard frames and available assets.

---

### 1. The Held Breath — Ceci Claims the Hall
**Frames**: 1A, 1B, 1C
**Assets**: C1BG + C1FG1 (Ceci) + C1FG2 (Jack)

- **Narrative goal**
    Introduce Ceci as the gravitational center and establish the confiscated hôtel hallway as a charged, improvised stage. Show the city pausing to breathe with her.

- **Primary emotion**
    **Suspended curiosity** — "Who _is_ she, and why does the room orbit her?"

- **Desired pace**
    **Linger.** Slow build. Let users arrive, acclimate to the darkness, and feel the held breath before anything "happens."

- **Layer choreography**
    - 1A: BG room + FG Ceci alone
    - 1B: Jack enters (C1FG2 fades in)
    - 1C: Both present, text progression

---

### 2. The Offer — Ink, Sheet Music, "Will You Follow?"
**Frames**: 2A, 2B
**Assets**: C2BG + C2FG1 (couple at table) + shared/couple-closeup

- **Narrative goal**
    Introduce Jack and the pivot: this isn't just a performance, it's a proposed re-writing of the dance. The relationship is framed as a _choice_.

- **Primary emotion**
    **Intimate tension** — not yet romantic heat, but the awareness that something consequential is being negotiated.

- **Desired pace**
    **Linger.** Users should read body language and micro-gestures. This is a consent contract scene, not a quick beat.

- **Layer choreography**
    - 2A: Table scene with sheet music
    - 2B: Transition to couple-closeup for "Consent lives in small sentences..."

---

### 3. Consent as Choreography — First Steps
**Frames**: 3A, 3B
**Assets**: C3BG (ballroom) + C3FG (couple dip pose)

- **Narrative goal**
    Make the ethics and chemistry visible: consent lives in small sentences and small motions. Their connection is choreographed, not assumed.

- **Primary emotion**
    **Trust + anticipation** — "Okay, they're in this together. Now what can they do?"

- **Desired pace**
    **Linger → then drift.** Hold on the dip pose, the pattern older than their names. Once the agreement is felt, the pace can gently accelerate into flow.

- **Layer choreography**
    - 3A: Full ballroom view with dancing couple
    - 3B: Same composition, text about mirror introduces next chapter

---

### 4. The Crack — Mirror Shatter & Call to the City
**Frames**: 4A, 4B
**Assets**: C4BG + shared/mirror-intact → shared/mirror-broken + shared/couple-standing

- **Narrative goal**
    Break the room open. The mirror falls, Ceci does not flinch, and her voice ("Un. Deux. Trois.") extends the scene into the square. This is the moment the private becomes public.

- **Primary emotion**
    **Shock → exhilaration** — a jolt followed by a sense of "the world is about to tip."

- **Desired pace**
    **Skim → then punch.** The actual impact of the mirror should feel like a sharp beat; the fallout (voice through windows) can be a quick, kinetic sequence.

- **Layer choreography**
    - 4A: Mirror intact, tension building
    - 4B: Mirror broken (swap FG layer), couple standing, "Un. Deux. Trois."

---

### 5. Authority Enters — Boots in the Square
**Frames**: 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D
**Assets**: C5BG (square) + C5FG1 (boots) + C5BG2 (night street)

- **Narrative goal**
    Introduce external stakes: patrol, orders, the threat of shutting this down. Ground the story in the revolution and power structures.

- **Primary emotion**
    **Unease / tightening** — the sense that something powerful but fragile is under threat.

- **Desired pace**
    **Skim.** This is a context beat. Users should feel the pressure, not dwell here; we're setting up the contrast with what Ceci does next.

- **Layer choreography**
    - 5A: Square scene with boots FG (authority POV)
    - 5B-D: Night street scene, text progression about patrol and Ceci's response

---

### 6. Violet Window — Phantom Stage Silhouette (Hero Beat)
**Frames**: 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6E
**Assets**: C4BG + shared/mirror-broken + shared/couple-standing, shared/exterior-windows-silhouette, C2BG + shared/couple-closeup

- **Narrative goal**
    Deliver the iconic image: Ceci kills the lanterns, floods the windows with violet, and their silhouettes become a single phantom stage for the entire square.

- **Primary emotion**
    **Awe.** This is the poster moment—the one image the experience hangs on.

- **Desired pace**
    **Linger, hard.** This is a full-stop beat. Let users sit in the tableau before moving again; scroll here should feel like panning around a painting.

- **Layer choreography**
    - 6A-B: Interior ballroom with broken mirror, couple
    - 6C, 6E: Exterior windows silhouette (hero shot)
    - 6D: Intimate closeup ("Follow me", "Always")

---

### 7. Heat & Tide — "Follow Me," "Always," Crowd vs Patrol
**Frames**: 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D
**Assets**: C7BG (crowd square), shared/exterior-windows-silhouette, C7BG2 (interior windows)

- **Narrative goal**
    Interweave the intimate and the political: their closer-than-required dance, whispered lines, and the square below transforming into a single moving organism that pushes authority back.

- **Primary emotion**
    **Collective exhilaration + romantic heat** — the thrill of seeing private desire and public defiance in sync.

- **Desired pace**
    **Rich, flowing skim.** This is where motion gets most layered. Scroll should feel like surfing a continuous waltz—no abrupt stops, but many visual micro-beats.

- **Layer choreography**
    - 7A: Crowd scene (complete BG, no separate layers)
    - 7B: Exterior windows (reused shared asset)
    - 7C-D: Interior windows scene (complete BG)

---

### 8. Release — Final Note, Shared Breath in the Dark
**Frames**: 8A, 8B, 8C, 8D, 8E
**Assets**: C8BG (street soldiers), C8BG2 (dancing crowd), C8BG3 (night interior)

- **Narrative goal**
    Let the spell end with grace. The violet light gutters out, the city exhales, Ceci and Jack share a held, quiet closeness in the dark.

- **Primary emotion**
    **Tenderness / bittersweet calm** — a warm afterglow with the awareness that it can't last unchanged.

- **Desired pace**
    **Linger.** Slow down again. This is a decompression chamber between the spectacle and the mundane morning.

- **Layer choreography**
    - 8A, 8C: Street scene with soldiers retreating
    - 8B, 8D: Dancing crowd triumph
    - 8E: Night interior, final note fades, forehead touch

---

### 9. Residue & Dawn — Glass, Ribbon, Marked Door, Dawn Hold
**Frames**: 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D
**Assets**: C9BG (dawn room) + C9FG (couple brooms), C9BG2 (CJ door), C9BG3 (brooms floor)

- **Narrative goal**
    Show the aftermath and myth: sweeping glass, violet ribbon trapped under a shard, the chalked C/J mark on the backstage door, brooms crossed and breath shared at dawn.

- **Primary emotion**
    **Melancholic satisfaction** — "That night is over, but its trace will echo, and they'll find each other again."

- **Desired pace**
    **Linger → gentle fade.** A sequence of still-life and micro-intimacy moments that the user can savor. This is the place for deliberate, almost static frames that invite slow reading rather than scrolling for "the next big thing."

- **Layer choreography**
    - 9A-B: Dawn room with couple holding brooms
    - 9C: CJ chalk mark on backstage door
    - 9D: Brooms and violet cloth on floor (final hold)

## Asset Reality Check

**What we have:**
- BG layers per scene (complete illustrations)
- Selective FG layers for key characters and objects
- Shared assets for reused elements

**What we don't have:**
- Separate crowd layers (crowds are baked into BGs)
- Separate patrol/soldier elements
- MG layers for most scenes

**Motion implications:**
- Parallax limited to BG vs FG (2-3 layers max)
- Scene transitions via crossfade/opacity
- No complex crowd animation—treat crowd BGs as single organisms
- Character movement via FG layer transform/opacity

This chapter map is your spine.
Next phases—macro-transitions, scroll timelines, layout—should treat these as **beats in a dance**, not just "pages in a story."
